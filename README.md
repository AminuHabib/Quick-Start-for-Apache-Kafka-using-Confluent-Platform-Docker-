# Quick-Start-for-Apache-Kafka-using-Confluent-Platform-Docker-

Use this quick start to get up and running with Confluent Platform and its main components using Docker containers. This quick start uses Confluent Control Center included in Confluent Platform for topic management and event stream processing using ksqlDB.

In this quick start, you create Apache KafkaÂ® topics, use Kafka Connect to generate mock data to those topics, and create ksqlDB streaming queries on those topics. You then go to Control Center to monitor and analyze the event streaming queries.
